# The disk and the bootloader, for a Hetzner Cloud VM.
#
# # Both boot paths, because guessing wrong is invisible
#
# This machine may be BIOS or UEFI and nothing in the configuration can ask.
# Hetzner Cloud x86 instances have historically booted SeaBIOS; arm64 and newer
# types are UEFI. An earlier version of this file installed a UEFI-only GRUB,
# copied from `hetzner-nixos-uefi` whose name says what it assumed.
#
# The failure that produces is the worst available here: `nixos-anywhere`
# reports `### Done! ###`, the disk is written correctly, the provider says the
# server is running, and the machine never boots. There is nothing to see and no
# error anywhere. Two machines went that way before this comment existed.
#
# So the disk carries a BIOS boot partition AND an ESP, and GRUB is installed to
# both. It costs 1 MB and a few seconds, and it removes a question that can only
# be answered by buying a machine and watching it not come back.
#
# # Root is btrfs, and the reasoning is worth keeping
#
# It was ext4, which was drift rather than a decision: this file was written from
# `hetzner-nixos-uefi`, which is root on ZFS, and the disk layout is the one part
# of a template that evaluating cannot check, so the simplification was never
# caught.
#
# The fix was nearly ZFS, to match that machine. What decided against it is the
# size of box this template actually lands on. ZFS caches in the ARC rather than
# in the page cache, and the ARC wants a real share of memory: capped hard it
# still costs a few hundred megabytes, and left alone it takes HALF of RAM. On a
# 4 GB machine running a browser and an agent session that is the wrong trade,
# and 4 GB machines are the common case here rather than the small one.
#
# btrfs caches in the ordinary page cache, so its memory cost is close to ext4's,
# and it still answers the question ext4 cannot:
#
# `docs/DESIGN-machines.md` calls the armed undo the most load-bearing mechanism
# in the design, and then says what limits it: a generation restores
# CONFIGURATION, not DATA. Roll back a bad deploy on ext4 and you get yesterday's
# configuration pointed at today's state. Somebody who rolls back and finds it did
# not help is worse off than somebody who never trusted it. The pre-switch
# snapshot below is the other half, and it needs a filesystem that can take one.
#
# What is given up against ZFS: a real read cache, multi-disk, send/receive
# parity, dedup. None of those matter on a single-disk cloud VM, and the last two
# were never wanted. What is given up against ext4: copy-on-write fragments, so
# anything doing small random writes wants `chattr +C` on its directory, and a
# full filesystem reports oddly because data and metadata are allocated
# separately. Both are real and both are the price of the paragraph above.
#
# `nix/host.nix` in the ryra repo stays on ZFS deliberately. That box is larger,
# it runs Postgres, and there the ARC earns the memory it takes.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------- before a switch

  # A snapshot of the data, taken before the configuration changes.
  #
  # This is the half of the armed undo that generations cannot do. NixOS keeps
  # the previous generation and that restores CODE: roll back and the binaries
  # are yesterday's while the state is still today's.
  #
  # `preSwitchChecks` rather than an activation script, because a check that
  # FAILS stops the switch. A deploy that could not snapshot should not proceed:
  # the snapshot is the only reason the next ten minutes are recoverable.
  #
  # Absolute paths, and this is not tidiness. Pre-switch checks run under
  # `systemd-run` with a minimal PATH, so a bare `date` is not found, the
  # snapshot fails, and the whole deploy aborts with `date: command not found`.
  # It works during a fresh install only because that runs with a full PATH,
  # which is what makes it a trap: it passes the first time and fails on the
  # first real deploy. `hetzner-nixos-uefi` hit this on ZFS and wrote it down,
  # and nothing about it was specific to ZFS.
  #
  # Read-only snapshots, because these exist to be read back from and nothing
  # should be able to write into one by accident.
  #
  # Two things this is NOT. Not a backup: same filesystem, same disk, and losing
  # the disk loses every snapshot with it. And not free to roll back, because it
  # discards everything written since, including work somebody did in the
  # meantime. It is a decision, not an undo button.
  #
  # NOTHING PRUNES THESE YET. A snapshot is nearly free when taken and grows as
  # the original diverges, so a machine deployed to often will accumulate. That
  # is a real gap and it is left open rather than guessed at: how long is worth
  # keeping is a decision somebody should make, and btrfs reports a full
  # filesystem confusingly enough that it should not be discovered by hitting it.
